# Training Dataset

## NOTE

Data TBA!  
Expected release on **9 August 2021 (23:55 GMT+7)**  
We're currently checking our data format.

## Description

This folder contains the data used to train our system in the paper

To recall, this data captures a single colloquial transformation, therefore, the data does *not* alyways contain formal-informal pairs. Instead, it is possible to have informal-informal pair.

Consider the following case of word `temen2`, which is constructed from `teman-teman`.
In such case, we have to apply 2 transformations as follow:

```
1. teman-teman + space-dash -> teman2
2. teman2 + sound-alter -> temen2
```

Therefore, you will also find a pair of `teman2; temen2; sound-alter` in the dataset, despite both being informal words.

If you are looking for end-to-end formal-informal Indonesian dictionary, you can access here: TBA.
